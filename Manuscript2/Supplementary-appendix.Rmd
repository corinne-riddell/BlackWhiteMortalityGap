**Table S1** lists the specific causes of death that contribute to the “all other causes” major categorization. The majority of these deaths are among infants, as shown by the large magnitude of mortality rates for deaths among those < 1 year in **Figure S1**. Thus, the first row of this figure provides a rough approximation to the overall rate of infant mortality. Among the other age groups, the exact cause is most often “Symptoms, signs, and ill-defined conditions”. Each plot shows three lines per race, which are often overlapping (except for 1-19 year olds). The line type indicates the imputation strategy for the suppressed death counts, where we set all suppressed counts to 1 (solid line, lower bound), 5 (dotted line, midpoint) or 9 (dashed line, upper bound).

While injury rates are relatively low in women compared to men, the injury category is comprised of many distinct sources of injury including motor vehicle accidents, homicide, suicide, and poisonings, each of having their own distinct trends that are unfortunately masked in aggregation. Each plot shows three lines per race, which are often overlapping (except for 1-19 year olds). The line type indicates the imputation strategy for the suppressed death counts, where we set all suppressed counts to 1 (solid line, lower bound), 5 (dotted line, midpoint) or 9 (dashed line, upper bound).
