In our main analyses, we included Hispanics as part of the black and white racial groups. To investigate the impact of including Hispanics on mortality, we inspected mortality trends for five key states with large Hispanic immigrant populations (California, New York, Florida, Texas, and Illinois). We extracted this mortality data using (CDC WONDER's)\[<https://wonder.cdc.gov/>\] compressed mortality file. Hispanic ethnicity is only available beginning in 1999, so we consider the time period from 1999 to 2013. We extract age-adjusted mortality rates related to the circulatory system ("CVD", ICD-10 codes I00-I99), neoplasms ("cancers", ICD-10 codes C00-D48) and external causes ("injuries", ICD-10 codes V01-Y89) by year, state, race, and gender, for (a) non-Hispanics and (b) regardless of Hispanic ethinicity.
